# REU-2023
The files in this repo coincide with my paper "Dimensionality Reduction and the Fenchel Game". Here are some key notes:
- Please replace the file path in the laplacian_eigenmaps_nn_experiment with the path to your machine. 
- Feel free to test out various values of t nearest neighbors (hyperparameter) for the laplacian_eigenmaps_helix_experiment.
- To run the numpy_neuralnet.ipynb, please replace the "archive" file path to that on your machine linked to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

# Helix and Swiss Roll Experimentation
- Accessed through laplacian_eigenmaps_helix_swiss_roll_experiments.ipynb
- This is a Jupyter notebook that tests three different LE algos on both helix and swiss roll data sets
- Note that the code for the algorithms themselves is in laplacian_eigenmaps_functions.ipynb

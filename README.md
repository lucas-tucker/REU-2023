# REU-2023
The files in this repo coincide with my paper "Dimension Reduction and the Fenchel Game". Here are some key notes:
- The argparse cell (which downloads the MNIST data onto your machine) in the laplacian_eigenmaps_neuralnet_experiment.ipynb file is currently not working since I am still integrating my LE algorithms with the torch model. Please replace cell 6 with your machine's path to laplacian_eigenmaps_functions, which contains the supplementary functions to the experiment.
- To run the numpy_neuralnet.ipynb, please replace the "archive" file path to that on your machine linked to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
